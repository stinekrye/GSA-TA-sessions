# The naive algorithm:
# It will compare the first index of the substring to all indexes of the reference string. When a match is found, the second index of the substring is compared to the next index of the ref. string.
# If the match can be extented to cover the entire substring a match is found!


# Warm up
# 1: How would I test the correctness of the algorithm?
    # Make a "test-suite" which has a lot of substrings and reference sequences to match
    # Make a test, which checks how the indexes are moved around

# 2: How would you use that naive algorithm to test a more sophisticated algorithm?
    # I would check if they find the same matches?


# 3a: How do you test the running time of an algorithm?
    # Feed it input of different lengths, measure the time and make a graph

# Implementation of the na√Øve algorithm
    # What output is desired? I decide to only output the match and the pythonic index of the match
