# The naive algorithm:
# It will compare the first index of the substring to all indexes of the reference string. When a match is found, the second index of the substring is compared to the next index of the ref. string.
# If the match can be extented to cover the entire substring a match is found!


# Warm up
# 1: How would I test the correctness of the algorithm?
    # Make a "test-suite" which has a lot of substrings and reference sequences to match
        # Start with simple cases, then build a test suite
        # Good idea to make this random, and sample subsequences at specific indexes. Or generate sequences with a specific edit distance from a template
        # Write special cases by hand (empty strings, strings with same character, prefix and suffix)
        # Use classes of strings, which are different: Random, repetitive (fibonnaci?)
        # Compare to already working algorithms

# 2: How would you use that naive algorithm to test a more sophisticated algorithm?
    # I would check if they find the same matches?


# 3a: How do you test the running time of an algorithm?
    # Feed it input of different lengths, measure the time and make a graph
    # For each alg make a graph with time/expeced runningtime* as a function of n, with different lines for m
        # How can we derive the expected running time?

# Implementation of the na√Øve algorithm
    # What output is desired? I decide to only output the match and the pythonic index of the match
